# invoicing-roi-simulator
Overview

This project is a lightweight ROI Calculator that helps businesses compare manual vs. automated invoicing.
It allows users to input key parameters and view cost savings, ROI, and payback period instantly.
The goal is to demonstrate how automation always results in positive financial outcomes using a bias factor.

 Planned Architecture

The app follows a simple 3-tier architecture:

Frontend (React.js) — for interactive UI and real-time simulation.

Backend (Node.js + Express.js) — handles calculations, APIs, and PDF report generation.

Database (MongoDB) — stores saved scenarios with CRUD support.

Flow:
User → Frontend (form inputs) → API → Backend logic → DB (for save/load) → Result displayed → Optional PDF download (email gated)

 Technologies & Frameworks
Layer	Tech Stack
Frontend	React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend	Node.js, Express.js
Database	MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)
Hosting (optional)	Render / Vercel
Report Generation	html-pdf / pdfkit
API Testing	Postman

 Key Features

Quick Simulation

Takes user inputs (invoice volume, team size, wage, etc.).

Instantly calculates monthly savings, payback, and ROI.

Scenario Management (CRUD)

Save, view, and delete named scenarios.

Retrieve results later.

Report Generation (Lead Capture)

Generate downloadable PDF report after entering an email.

PDF includes all simulation results.

Positive ROI Logic

Built-in bias factor (min_roi_boost_factor = 1.1) ensures automation shows better results.

Responsive Design

Works smoothly on desktop and mobile.

Core Calculations

The backend will perform:

labor_cost_manual = num_ap_staff × hourly_wage × avg_hours_per_invoice × monthly_invoice_volume
auto_cost = monthly_invoice_volume × automated_cost_per_invoice
error_savings = (error_rate_manual - error_rate_auto) × monthly_invoice_volume × error_cost
monthly_savings = (labor_cost_manual + error_savings) − auto_cost
monthly_savings *= min_roi_boost_factor

cumulative_savings = monthly_savings × time_horizon_months
net_savings = cumulative_savings − one_time_implementation_cost
payback_months = one_time_implementation_cost ÷ monthly_savings
roi_percentage = (net_savings ÷ one_time_implementation_cost) × 100

Development Plan (3 Hours)
Time	Task
0–15 min	Plan architecture + setup repo + submit documentation
15–75 min	Build backend APIs + connect MongoDB
75–120 min	Create frontend UI + integrate API
120–150 min	Add PDF report + test + final deploy
